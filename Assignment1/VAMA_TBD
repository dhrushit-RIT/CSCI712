these steps are for set up

to install all the packages needed
npm -i

to run the code:
npm run build -- --watch

if you want to know how this is working, let me know
in summay, if you check the index file, the files are coming from dist folder


to get used to the code:
switch to branch - learning
git checkout learning
I have commented out the other two canvases so that code does not go to multiple places

set debugger at animate function in the app.ts
go into the getKFAt function and explore using the step over, step into etc.

explore the code:
all the needed files are in src folder
all classes are in the claasses folder
all animators are in the classes/Animators folder
main file is app.ts
utilclasses is no longer needed



basically observe the sequence of steps. the goal is to 
1. deconstruct the problem into smaller sets of solvable problems
2. make functions of the smallest problem you solvable
3. to re use the functions for solving other problems

to do:
1. switch to branch feature/bezierImplementation
2. implement the interpolatePosition function to call your function. it should return a Position
3. regularly check the output in the browser
